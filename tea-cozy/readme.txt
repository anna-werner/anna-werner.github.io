This is my version of the Tea Cozy Project. 
I changed some of the layout requests and tested other things (I wanted to try using parallax, for example).
I personally like the outcome better.
You don't have to give me feedback therefor, on wether or not I met the design specifications.

But I did focus on using the flex-box etc. to get the same results in the positioning.

Thank you for looking at my project!
